# Changelog

## 0.2.0-alpha.1 — prepared, not yet published

Breaking alpha; Node.js 22/24, MIT, ESM, dependency-free core.

- Replace global ID access and per-record namespaces with namespace-bound clients.
- Introduce v2 serializable adapter transactions, insert-only capture, revisions,
  pagination, explicit deletion, PostgreSQL migrations and adapter conformance tests.
- Bind evaluations and approvals to immutable content/evidence hashes and versions.
- Unify manual/controller deployment with durable attempts, receipts, target
  reservations, reconciliation and explicit rollback lineage.
- Deduplicate scored signals by episode/execution, support late observations,
  reject non-finite values, exclude zero weight and remove `Finding.confidence`.
- Default to recommendations; bound proposal calls/candidates and callbacks;
  require explicit experimental opt-in for low-risk prompt/routing auto-apply.
- Add a PostgreSQL/OpenAI classification starter and clearly simulated CI fixtures.
- Make Fern canonical; retire duplicate website documentation and unsupported claims.
- Add packaging smoke tests, runnable-doc checks and CI release gates.

See `docs/migration.md`. Old deployment history cannot safely become active.

## 0.1.0 — private prototype

Initial capture, heuristic analysis and callback-based lifecycle. Not a supported
production deployment contract. No unsafe compatibility wrappers are carried forward.
